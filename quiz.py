# this is my first python project.

# I created a variable 'a' to store the welcome text and headline
a='Welcome to the quiz \n'

#printed the variable a by aligning it and converting the text into uppercase text.
print(a.center(55).upper())

#created a list to store questions
questions= ['1. What is the largest internal organ in the human body?','2. What is the percentage of the Earth covered by water?', '3. What was the name of Drakeâ€™s 2023 album?']


#a list to store the options/answers
answers=['1.Lungs','2.Heart','3.Kidneys','4.Liver','1. 51%','2. 61%','3. 71%','4. 81%','1. Take Care','2. Scorpion','3. For All The Dogs','4. Views']

  #a variable earnings to store the total earning
